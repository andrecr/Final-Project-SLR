        <div class="title">Sea Level Rise</div>
        Many coastal areas in the United States are expected to be underwater in the next few decades, including New York’s Rockaway community. However, residents aren’t planning on leaving their flood prone neighborhoods despite worsening conditions due to sea level rise, which are then exacerbated by external effects, such as garbage clogged sewage systems. Our role is to empower residents through creation of action oriented solutions that engage them to invest in themselves and create a personal and real connection with sea level rise. We will be working with the communities to find ways to adapt to their changing environment, as part of it, we are using CUSP maps.<br/><br/>My first visit to OpenVis Conf in 2013.

        <div class="title">Filler Words</div>
        As expected, I could only focus on the flaws: the rushed speech, the odd phrases, and, most especially, all the filler words. In fact, I found 180 filler words in my 30 minute talk.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">My Talk</div>
        Here are all 5,040 words of my talk.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">My Stumbles</div>
        And here are all the fillers I used in those 30 minutes.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Um's, Ah's &amp; Uh's</div>
        I almost exclusively used these three fillers. Um's and Ah's made up over 80%, with Uh's trailing behind.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Fillers Over Time</div>
        I hoped that all these blunders were toward the beginning of my talk. And the data suggests that fewer fillers are used as I get into it. Perhaps the talk started out rough and improved as I found my groove.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Ramping Back Up</div>
        Unfortunately, the trend does not continue. Midway into the talk my Um's and Ah's spike. I continue to use them pretty consistently throughout the rest of the talk.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">The Cough Effect</div>
        My theory is that at this critical halfway point in my talk, I heard a dry cough indicative of the audience's waning interest. This caused self-confidence to collapse and forced me out of my groove.<br/><br/>A competing theory is that I just hadn't practiced the last half of my speech as much.

        <div class="title">Best of Luck to Me in 2015</div>
        The world may never know, or care, but hopefully these insights improve my speaking in 2015. Though preliminary results aren't looking so good.
